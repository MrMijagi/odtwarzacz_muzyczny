Songs should be added through add button on menu. Then dialog open which allows user to choose audio file. Unfortunately list of songs/tracks isn't saved, so user has to add all songs after every restart. I tried to save and load them by saving uri of each file but the app would crash each time because there was no access to it after restart (at least I think this was the reason, I gave up after few hours).

Aside from adding songs it is also possible to remove them by swiping.
